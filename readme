# Product List Search

This code creates an HTML page with a search bar and a submit button inside a form. When the form is submitted, the code performs a search on the data using the value entered in the search bar and displays the results in cards below the search bar.

## How it works

The code uses JavaScript to add an event listener to the form that listens for the `submit` event. When the form is submitted, the event listener function is called and performs the following steps:

1. Prevents the default form submission behavior.
2. Hides any previous error messages.
3. Gets the value of the search input.
4. If the search term is empty, displays an error message and returns.
5. Filters the data to find items that match the search term.
6. If no results are found, displays an error message and returns.
7. Clears any previous error messages and search results.
8. Sorts the results in ascending order by `productName`.
9. For each result, creates a new card element and appends it to the results element.
